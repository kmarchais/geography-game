# .nojekyll file for GitHub Pages

This empty file prevents GitHub Pages from using Jekyll to process the site.

## Why this file exists

- Prevents MIME type issues where JavaScript modules are incorrectly served as "video/mp2t"
- Allows all files to be served with their correct content types
- Ensures paths with underscores (_) work properly (Jekyll ignores them by default)
- Fixes the "Failed to load module script" error that causes blank/white screens

## Technical background

Without this file, GitHub Pages processes the site with Jekyll, which can interfere with:

- ES modules loading
- Asset paths
- Special file types

For Vite applications, this file is essential for proper deployment on GitHub Pages.
