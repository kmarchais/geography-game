# Bun Configuration
# https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/bunfig

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This project uses Vitest, not Bun's native test runner
#
# ✅ Use: bun run test    (runs Vitest - correct)
# ❌ Don't use: bun test  (runs Bun's test runner - incompatible)
#
# Unfortunately, Bun's test runner cannot be fully disabled.
# The test configuration below is for Bun's native runner (if accidentally used),
# but all project tests are designed for Vitest.

[test]
# Coverage configuration (not used, but here for reference)
# coverage = false
